# Timezone App

This timezone app is a consequence of a group working project which I started with a big friend of mine, Remi. This perfect combination of his passion for web development and yet little knowledge on the field, has allowed me to put in pratice some of my technical skills and improve on others skills such as _know how to teach_ programming and figure out solutions. The app, despite being simple, has still required some work which is explained in the section below. But it essentially is a responsive web app that gives to the user the time of 5 different cities accross the world, with their corresponded timezones.

## Process

I decided to first implement the code that allowed me to hit an Api, in order to get the response back with the timezones of the selected cities. Here is the link of the Api I have used should you want to take a look or use it yourself: https://api.ipgeolocation.io/timezone? 

Once I got the resquests and reponses and the data needed, still with Javascript, I rerefenced the buttons and added the event listners logic that sees the clicked buttons to display the time. I even went an extra mile and figured out a way to update the time in live. Amazing! it was quite fun! Then, I set up Boostrap 4 to build a decent looking frontend interface in no time. And voila! I got the page working ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜„

Overall, I enjoyed a lot working on this project with my big friend Remi. The challanges that the project presented in the different phases of its development have got me better at programming and teaching, no doubt! I hope to keep doing more and more of it. Also, just to terminate, if there was one thing I would like to improve on this project, that would be the code refactoring. I am aware that there are a lot that can be done on code effeciency and page time loading; even on the (UX) user experience.
